1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,560
Digital privacy
doesn't always make headline news

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,120
unless celebrity nudes are leaked

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,600
or compromising corporate emails
are made public.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,200
But our relationship to the internet
has reached

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,880
an unprecedented level
of connectedness.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,080
In this new environment, the state
of privacy deserves a closer look.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,880
In this series I will travel
the world to undergo challenges

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,080
that will explore our digital life
in the 21st century.

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's look at how we got here.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Before the 1600s
most people's homes were communal.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,480
Life orientated
around a central fireplace.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,240
There was very little privacy
or personal space.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,960
And then a revolutionary
new technology, the chimney.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,840
People could lock themselves
and their things in personal spaces.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,160
They began
to appreciate their privacy

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,080
and expect that what happened
behind closed doors stayed there.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,520
The rich have always had
better control over their privacy.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,440
In 1890s Boston, Warren and Brandeis
were attorneys for the high society.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,160
So, the next tech innovation
came along.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,120
Their clients had grown accustomed
to letting their hair down

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,240
behind closed doors.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,960
When photos of their parties landed
on the front-pages of gossip rags,

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,600
they were suitably outraged
and sued them.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,360
They won
and the right to privacy was born.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,960
Now, that was fine until the next big
tech innovation came along

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,760
and put a device
into our homes and our pockets

27
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,560
that lets us air our dirty laundry
to the world.

28
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,120
Our attitudes and the law
haven't caught up yet.

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,640
I'm in Los Angeles to meet Max,
a professional digital detective,

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,920
who protects business and celebrity
online reputations.

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,640
I gave him just my name
and then challenged him

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,920
to gather
as much information about me

33
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,680
from what I'd willingly
shared online.

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,840
- You ready to go through the box?
- I'm a bit nervous, to be fair.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,360
Let's walk you through it.
This is scratching the surface.

36
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,800
This is a couple of hours of work.

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,680
That's pretty deep.

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,360
You have
a pretty sizeable digital footprint

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,760
and most of this represents media
that you put out yourself.

40
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,720
You might say to me, "I'm not worried
about you revealing any information."

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,000
But if I'm looking to get you to do
something you might not want to do,

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm going to use anything
at my disposal

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,560
to create
some psychological leverage.

44
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,040
- All right. What is that?
- Your personal media footprint.

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,800
Right. OK.

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,560
These are all terrible pictures
that I took with silly hair and...

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,840
Lots and lots of selfies.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,760
And places that you go
that you yelp about.

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,120
Did I yelp?

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,000
Your location is revealed,
documenting yourself

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,640
and capturing unintended clues.

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,280
All of this I've intended.
Absolutely all of this I've intended.

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,480
You've got a grin on your face.
That says we're about to dive into...

54
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,680
Yes. OK. So now we're getting...

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,520
How did you find all of my addresses?

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,080
Because you did a registration.
You signed a document.

57
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,200
Your previous addresses,
pieces of ownership.

58
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,520
- Yes.
- And photographs from the inside.

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,720
Wow. Oh, my gosh.

60
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,680
- Because now that's on Airbnb.
- A walk-through of your spaces.

61
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,240
Yes. My assets.

62
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm gaining more and more
personal information, including...

63
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,400
That's my business addresses,
tax exemptions,

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,040
all of my company business.

65
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,280
Yes. Your worth. Your finances.

66
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,160
This goes into a larger question

67
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,760
of how companies are treating
their technology and their policy

68
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
if they even have a policy.

69
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,800
In many cases
I've seen it's an afterthought.

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,480
In start-up mode, many companies,
they hire their developers

71
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,840
and then the information policy
comes much, much later.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,320
But doing it from the beginning,
when you register that domain,

73
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,800
create these corporations,
you're starting that footprint.

74
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,280
You need to control that
from the beginning

75
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,040
and I'm going to come back
to the human element

76
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,920
and the people that you care about
and that you love

77
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,760
because you've done overall
a very good job of hiding.

78
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,280
There are a few things I could use
to exploit more information,

79
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,040
but if I'm looking to get you to do
something you might not want to do,

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,720
here's where your human interactions
betray you.

81
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,680
Your mum tweets about you.

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,080
Yes, she does.

83
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,080
And your mum doesn't button up
her personal information.

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,880
And I found out where she lived
and I sent somebody to her house.

85
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,440
No?!

86
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,720
- She wasn't home then.
- I think she was here.

87
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,520
But I know where she lives.

88
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,960
That's recent
because that's the new porch!

89
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,720
That's not an old photograph.

90
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,720
- That's creepy!
- This was two days ago.

91
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,240
Yes, that's...

92
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,880
Your friends and your family
might not be so tight.

93
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,640
What we're looking at here is a pile
of things that have been indexed

94
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,920
and then over time,
as software gets more sophisticated,

95
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,560
they'll get more searchable
and obtainable.

96
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,240
We cast long digital shadows.

97
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,880
If an individual
can leave this much of a mark,

98
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,720
imagine the footprint left by a
business with hundreds of employees

99
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,920
all with the company email addresses,

100
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,680
all contributing
to the collective online reputation.

101
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,640
But what happens when data that was
never meant for public consumption

102
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,200
ends up in the wrong hands?

103
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,080
Rethinking privacy
will become even more urgent

104
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,280
as we delve
into the world of hacking.
