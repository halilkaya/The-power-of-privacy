1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,360
In the modern world, a huge amount
of information is collected about us

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,480
as we go about our daily lives.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,520
Whether we disclose it
willingly or unwittingly,

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,320
this valuable data is now a commodity

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,640
that is traded
amongst a handful of companies.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,480
But what if there was a way to
harness it for the collective good?

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,920
In this episode I'll use my data

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,560
to help map the fallout
of the Fukushima nuclear disaster.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,600
Trading data is hardly a new thing.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,640
We've always benefitted
from sharing information.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,000
It's helped to advance civilisation.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,840
The internet is the latest
in a long line of technologies

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,440
that have ushered in
great innovations and social change.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,160
Trade routes introduced mathematics
and astronomy from Arabia,

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,400
weapons and vaccinations from China

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,360
and spices and philosophies
from the subcontinent.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,600
The printing press
blew apart traditional hierarchies,

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,920
letting the people
interpret and proclaim,

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,960
rather than those in power.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,000
The telegraph
brought the world closer together,

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,400
disrupting business,
governance and the judicial system.

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,800
And every step of the way the powers
that be tried to claw back control.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,680
Today there are three-billion people
communicating through the internet.

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,160
This latest network has given
each of us the empowering ability

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,320
to collaborate, share and exchange
information rapidly and efficiently.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,720
I'm headed to Japan where I'm going
to volunteer to test radiation levels

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,840
using a community-built
Geiger counter.

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,200
After the disaster in March 2011,
information about radiation hazards

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,720
that was being released
by the government

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,360
was at best incomplete,
often contradictory

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,600
and ultimately not really reliable.

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,600
So we felt it was one thing to say,

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,640
"My government tells me radiation
level is X. I guess I'll believe it."

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,560
Or to go and measure it yourself.

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,960
If you measure it yourself, you can
have confidence in that data.

36
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,920
SafeCast was really formed
to allow citizens

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,240
to gather the information they needed
and to disseminate it in a free way.

38
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,400
SafeCast Geiger kits are open-source.

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,000
Through building the devices,
people learn how the technology works

40
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,360
and as a consequence
many have offered

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,840
both hardware
and software improvements.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,800
This has helped
to rapidly evolve the design.

43
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,800
In 18 months SafeCast
went from a very large bulky system

44
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,280
with a detector
on the outside of the car

45
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,160
that required
being tethered to a laptop

46
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,040
down to this very small nano,
which is the current unit.

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,040
Seven separate designs in 18 months.

48
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,520
We think it's more than any startup
in any universe has ever done.

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,720
If I were a company
or an institution,

50
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,720
how long would it take me to do one?

51
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,760
Sometimes two years
for a new product.

52
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,400
Nobody does it so quickly.

53
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,320
The only reason
we're able to do it

54
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,720
is because we leverage these
open-source tools to speed this up.

55
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,680
You opened it up and said "This is
what we're thinking about doing"

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,040
The community came back and said
you could do it... better this way?

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,320
It's a bit chaotic in ways, but
it's very quick, agile and flexible.

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,920
People from all sorts of walks
of life participate -

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,040
anti-nuclear or pro-nuclear.

60
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,800
Teachers, housewives -
anyone can build it and submit data.

61
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,280
How can organisations wisely protect
the data that they're collecting?

62
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,040
The most important thing we found
the need to protect is privacy.

63
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,200
The privacy of volunteers. We allow
them to participate anonymously.

64
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,160
In Fukushima Prefecture
there was concern that people

65
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,920
would have radiation levels
in their front yard publicised

66
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,240
and that this could
affect them negatively.

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,440
Because of that, we decided
to use a hardware hack

68
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,040
to allow them to put the data
in a grid of 100 metres

69
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,080
that doesn't identify that data spot
with a particular person's property.

70
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,320
How much of Japan has been mapped?

71
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,600
We argue that we have been able
to provide a wider coverage

72
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,280
of radiation surveys
than the government has

73
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,120
because of the activities
of very active volunteers.

74
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,720
Certainly, Fukushima
has been repeatedly mapped

75
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,520
for three years or more.

76
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,440
There are a few corners
no volunteers have been to,

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,720
so today we can go
to a park in Koto Ward,

78
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,640
called Kiyosumi Park,
and we can check that out.

79
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,200
We're looking
at 0.1 microsieverts per hour.

80
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,480
This is about normal.
Pretty average for Tokyo.

81
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,480
How does that compare with,
say, the epicentre of the accident?

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,400
This is a piece of a deck that
one of our volunteers was building

83
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,840
when the disaster happened
in Koriyama,

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,240
which is one of the fairly
radioactive places in Fukushima.

85
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,840
- Listen to that!
- Yes.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,320
You can hear it.
It's like a scary noise.

87
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,680
It's already now 10 times
what it was...

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,680
- This is a very radioactive sample.
- That is significantly higher.

89
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,480
And this is the degree of fallout
that was everywhere in that area.

90
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,080
Inside the highly radioactive places
in Fukushima Daiichi reactor itself,

91
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
it's 1,000 times higher, or more.

92
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,760
We're getting to a point

93
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,760
where technically, because
of the hardware and software tools,

94
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,280
things that were
previously only possible

95
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,600
if you were a government
or a large research institution,

96
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,720
now a highschool kid can do.

97
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,000
This is going to get better,
quicker, easier and cheaper.

98
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,240
We are trying to show that potential.

99
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,360
This is an example of the agile
development organisations can use

100
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,360
when they open up
and engage their contributors.

101
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,640
By introducing privacy measures,

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,440
SafeCast has built confidence
in their project

103
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,680
and trust amongst
their collaborators.

104
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,680
This is an increasingly
important consideration,

105
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,760
as by 2020 it's estimated
that there will be 30-billion things

106
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,000
connected to the internet,

107
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,560
from transport, medical devices,
to household objects,

108
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,320
all of which will be collecting
and transmitting our information.

109
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,560
In the next episode, I'll explore
the privacy and data implications

110
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,560
by spending 24 hours
in a technology-laden smarthome.
