1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,800
A professional digital detective

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,320
has dredged up
my publicly available information,

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,640
but what about the online information
that we assume is secure,

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,920
like financial details,
credit card numbers,

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,920
health records,
business correspondence?

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,920
When a business falls victim
to a sensitive data breach,

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,440
the consequences
can be particularly devastating.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,240
In order to get a better idea of this
threat, I'm going to face it head-on.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm going to get
my Guardian computer hacked.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,920
The first hacker struck
at a live telegraph event in 1903.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,400
John Fleming was not pleased

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,760
that prankster and magician
Nevil Maskelyne

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,560
chose to insert insulting Morse code
into his fancy demo.

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,840
Modern-day hacking
started with a phone line.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,600
Freakers, as they were known,

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,840
spent the 1970s making
free international phone calls.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,400
In 1981, however, the first freaker
was convicted in the US for hacking,

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,400
but this hack helped to expose
the holes in the phone system.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,600
In 1988 the Morris worm
hit an early version of the internet,

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,400
exposing vulnerabilities
in this technology.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,080
In 2000 the Love Letter worm

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,640
infected 10% of the world's
internet-connected computers,

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,680
causing almost $9 billion
in damages worldwide.

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,360
It was a casually created joke
by two friends in the Philippines.

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,520
In recent years the new breed
of geeks are being hired

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,640
by governments,
financial systems and corporations

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,280
to both attack and defend.

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,400
I'm travelling to Las Vegas.

29
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,800
Here, annually, for the past 20 years
international hackers gather

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,760
to show off their skills
and exchange techniques.

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,080
We already know what can be learned
about me through a legal search,

32
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,960
but what can be uncovered
with specialist skills?

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,520
With my company computer
I'm visiting two hackers,

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,480
Khalil from Beirut
and Marton from Kentucky.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,280
Can they hack my laptop?

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,320
What is the security situation
like in the Middle East,

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,960
say, compared with Europe or the US?

38
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,400
I think the whole region is somewhere
between 5 to 10 years behind,

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
as far as awareness of the importance
of information security.

40
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,320
Mainly because the media
doesn't really talk about it.

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,560
In the States,
you turn on any TV channel

42
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,360
and there's a story about a big hack
because these things are publicised.

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,720
Yes, I've just got an email
from my director.

44
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,200
He says there's a good article
on the front-page of the Guardian.

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,680
Oh, Lord, there's nothing
but bad news down here, is there?

46
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,920
- That's the world for you.
- It is, isn't it?

47
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,120
Except there's a cool picture
from NASA.

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,680
As you're browsing
through the Guardian,

49
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,840
I just stole your credentials,
so I have your email address... .com

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,200
and the password is...

51
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,960
- A nice Guns N' Roses song.
- Thank you very much!

52
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,800
I'm actually compromising
your whole machine.

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,920
I could have downloaded files.

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,400
I could do a rickroll,
which is redirecting your browser.

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
- Never Gonna Give You Up.
- I just sent you to Rick Astley.

56
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
You did.

57
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,280
How did you crack my computer?

58
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,520
The website is not the Guardian.

59
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,280
It looks like the Guardian.

60
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,040
If you look at it carefully, which
people don't really do, on the URL,

61
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,120
it actually says "theguardlian",
so I added an "L" in there.

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,800
- But...
- Yes, you did. You did?

63
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,440
- Yes, I...
- It was added?

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,160
I registered the website,
the guardlian.com.

65
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,640
- That's available?
- It was. Not any more.

66
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,640
And so I cloned a live version
of the actual Guardian website,

67
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,560
so you wouldn't know
you're not there.

68
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,240
No, it looks exactly
like the Guardian.

69
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,000
It's enough to take control
of your whole computer

70
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,320
because you gave me access,
just clicking on the link.

71
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,640
I clicked through to the link

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,400
from a person
who sent me an email whom I trust.

73
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,200
Your Facebook and your LinkedIn
is out there.

74
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,880
We can find out
who you're associated with.

75
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,360
Then we can get their email
out of their LinkedIn or Facebook.

76
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,120
It's a very easy fake.

77
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,680
Is it as easy to do this
to company computers?

78
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,040
It's probably easier
because out of 100 or 1,000 people,

79
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,040
it's more probable
some of them will click the link.

80
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,000
Every year, international hackers
converge in Las Vegas

81
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,800
to attend a series of conferences -
Def Con, BSides and Black Hat.

82
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,040
Over a few weeks they exchange

83
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,440
the latest hacking
and security tricks and techniques.

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,000
We're here in Vegas,
kind of in the belly of the beast.

85
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,960
Are there any examples
of this kind of exploitation

86
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,560
happening in the wild?

87
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,240
Sure, in the old days,
and I mean five years ago,

88
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,520
we used to do
a lot of USB-based attacks

89
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,080
where we would drop them
around parking lots

90
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,480
and that was really common.

91
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,920
So what I want you to do
is plug that in.

92
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,720
For one, you don't ever want
to stick anything into your computer

93
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,240
that you don't actually know
what it is.

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,960
At this point I can do anything
I want to your computer.

95
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,680
I can do a key logger.
I can download and upload files.

96
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,520
You can see here that we're here
in the C:/Users/Aleksdirectory.

97
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,880
We noticed you have some business
files and some personal files.

98
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,520
- I do, yes.
- We'll download to our computer.

99
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,960
I don't want you to have that.

100
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,560
Now we can do a lot of things.

101
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,680
I could take screen shots
from your camera.

102
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,080
- Of me?
- Of you.

103
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,040
We can record the sound.

104
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,720
And then we're able
to download a file to your computer.

105
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,640
It's moving.

106
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,160
And set it
to your desktop background.

107
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,600
That's a fantastic picture, guys.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,760
- I've been hacked.
- Correct.

109
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,240
What about for corporations?
How are they vulnerable with this?

110
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,800
We've done
a number of penetration tests

111
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,440
where we've gone
to our local computer store.

112
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,160
We've bought 10 or 20 keyboards
and slotted one of these devices in

113
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,920
and packed them up
and sent them to the company.

114
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,200
What we've done is
put a fake letter in there that says,

115
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,840
"Hey, we're from HP. We want you
to check out our new keyboard.

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,680
"We're hoping if we give you
these 20 free models

117
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,920
"you'll buy 10,000 of them
because they're so great.

118
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,240
"Try these out."

119
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,120
Nobody resists free stuff.

120
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,360
If you make it expensive enough
and nice enough, people will use it.

121
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,680
But humans are humans.
Is there anything companies can do?

122
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,440
It's awareness training.

123
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,400
You can have
all the firewalls you want

124
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,120
and all the password policies.

125
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,920
If they get online and click on any
link, then it renders all that moot.

126
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,800
Sometimes we have to sacrifice
some convenience for safety.

127
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,840
If it's too good to be true,
either in an email format

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,040
or something you found
or something somebody sent you,

129
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,640
it probably is.

130
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Wow! It was quite unsettling
to see how easy it was to get hacked.

131
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,320
But the consequences of getting
hacked aren't always destructive.

132
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,640
Sometimes it ends up exposing
corporate vulnerabilities or flaws

133
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,880
that a business can address
and improve upon.

134
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,560
From this hack, the Guardian will be
more astute with domain registration.

135
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,760
In the next episode,
I'll explore how to take control

136
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,080
when you lose control
of your online image

137
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,640
and negative information
about you or your business

138
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,440
ends up splashed
all over the web.
